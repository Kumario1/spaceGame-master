Customized Space Invaders Project Overview

I took a classic Space Invaders game as my foundation and gave it a fresh, personalized twist. By starting with a solid base code, I was able to focus on enhancing the game with my unique touch. Here’s a snapshot of what I did:

Visual Upgrades: I replaced the original images with a diverse set of custom graphics, from vibrant alien designs to sleek spacecraft and dynamic backgrounds. This gave the game a distinctive look and feel, making it stand out.

Sound Enhancements: I integrated a variety of sound effects to enrich the gaming experience. Explosions, laser blasts, and background music all contribute to a more immersive atmosphere, adding a layer of excitement and engagement.

Scorekeeping: To add a competitive edge, I implemented a scorekeeping system. Players can now track their progress and aim for higher scores, making each game session more thrilling and rewarding.
